    "# Abstract \n",
    "\n",
    "Diabetes is a chronic health condition which affects approximately 422 million adults worldwide, with the majority of those affected living in low\\-income or underdeveloped countries. The timely diagnosis and treatment of diabetes can be crucial to patient health; access to insulin and health monitoring can be the difference between life and death. Our project aims to develop a binary classifier for diabetes based on the Diabetes Prediction Dataset from Kaggle; it provides multiple variables such as age, smoking history, blood measurements, and the presence of related conditions like hypertension and heart disease, of which we will be identifying the most significant features that contribute to diabetes. We aim to build the classifier using a random forest technique and validate our model using a train/validation/test split. We also plan to use grid search to optimize hyperparameters and measure our model's accuracy using recall and F1\\-Score.\n",

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Diabetes is a chronic, metabolic disease which has the potential to cause serious organ damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, and more. Type 2 diabetes is most common in adults, which we have seen rising prevalence of in recent years. Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin, and Type 1 diabetes occurs when the body does not produce enough insulin[\\[1\\]](#lorenznote). Both forms of diabetes require timely diagnosis and treatment, which is why building models to potentially identify diabetes based on various metrics is an important and necessary pursuit. In doing so, we may be able to diagnose individuals who carry markers or fit trends earlier than before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, identifying diabetes has to do with symptoms, not markers for disease. Type 1 diabetes can cause nausea, vomiting, or stomach pains; however, symptoms of Type 2 diabetes can take years to develop, and may never[\\[2\\]](#admonishnote)! So, predicting the disease without seeing symptoms has the potential to save lives. Progress has been made in terms of using machine learning to identify diabetes and other forms of disease. Logistic regression, random forest, a developed ensemble model, and SVM were all methods considered in a study by BMC Medical [\\[3\\]](#admonishnote). The developed ensemble model received an AU\\-ROC score of 73.7, which was the best performance without laboratory data. Similar studies have been conducted by the NIH and BioMed Central, showing that there is sure progress to be made in this realm. \n",

    "\n",
    "The dataset we will be using to accomplish our project is the [Diabetes Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset) from Kaggle, sourced from the Electronic Health Records \\(EHRs\\). It contains 100,000 observations of 9 variables. An observation consists of one entry of each of the following nine variables: gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, BMI, HbA1c level \\(Hemoglobin A1c\\), blood glucose level, and diabetes. Some of the critical variables are hypertension, heart disease, and diabetes, which are represented by a 0 or 1 to indicate the presence of the condition. Additionally, smoking history, BMI, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level are critical since they are common risk factors for diabetes. Smoking history is represented by one of 6 categories which we will use one\\-hot encoding to represent: not current, former, no info, current, never, and ever. We will filter out the observations with no info of smoking history to provide our model with more consistent data which will leave us with around 64,000 observations. BMI and HbA1c level are represented as whole number or decimal value, while blood glucose level is represented entirely by whole numbers.\n",

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are working on a binary classification task \\(whether or not a patient has diabetes\\), a reasonable classifier to use is a random forest, which has numerous advantages in the context of our dataset. Random forests are fast to train even on large datasets like ours and still retain good performance. They also can give an estimate as to which features are more significant in classification via permutation, which is important to know since we are trying to identify the most significant risk factors of diabetes. Furthermore, by the nature of using decision trees for classification, we won't have to scale our variables to match each other which could have been a concern since HbA1c level is on a much lower scale than blood glucose level and BMI. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a train/validation/test split to test our model since we have a lot of data. After initially training the random forest, we will use grid search to find the best hyperparameters for our model on the validation set. Finally, we will test our model on the test set and evaluate its performance. \n",

    "# Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Propose at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model. The evaluation metric(s) you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution. Describe how the evaluation metric(s) are derived and provide an example of their mathematical representations (if applicable). Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms).\n",
    "\n",
    "A valid evaluation metric for our problem would be recall, which is defined as the number of true positives divided by the number of true positives \\+ false negatives. We are most concerned with correctly identifying the presence of diabetes \\(true positive\\) and minimizing the number of times our model incorrectly identifies a patient with diabetes as not having diabetes \\(false negative\\), which is exactly what recall measures. However, it is also important to consider false positives, since theoretically a model could simply predict all patients as having diabetes and this would maximize recall but would have an over\\-abundance of false positives. For this reason, we will also be looking at the F1\\-score of our model as it takes into account precision and recall and gives us an idea of the overall accuracy of our model. Precision is defined as the number of true positives divided by the number of true positives \\+ false positives and F1\\-score is: $\\dfrac{2\\times Precision \\times Recall}{Precision+Recall}$ .\n"

    "When looking at data a major concern is the privacy of individuals: not allowing the public to be able to identify the person based on the information from this data.Â  Another concern would be that of consent: where the data that was collected was obtained forcefully from the patient. Our data was from Kaggle, where the person who obtained the data got it from various healthcare providers, such as hospitals and clinics. The patients allowed these healthcare providers to obtain this information from different tests. From these places they have a set of procedures that they need to follow inorder for them to get consent form the patients. When it comes to the privacy of the individuals, the data that was collected do not have specific enough information to make an individual known to the public therefore we can safely say that their privacy is secured. \n",

    "Another aspect that can be of concern is that of collection bias: where the data that was collected from a specific set of individuals that may be prone to what we are investigating or not be prone to, based on the methods of the data collection. A way this has been overcome was through the methods of how the data was collected from different electronic health records from different hospitals and clinics, therefore minimizing the amount of data that was collected specifically from individuals that may be prone to what we are investigating or not be prone to. Therefore our predictions from this dataset should not be exposed from collection bias.\n",
